## Application Overview

NexusPortal is a Flask 3 + Supabase/Postgres web application. It implements a
project and task management portal where users collaborate under strict role-based access
controls. Every route is protected server-side — the application enforces who
can see, create, edit, and delete data at the handler level, not just in the UI.

**Tech stack:**

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Web framework | Python 3.11 + Flask 3.1 |
| Database | Supabase Postgres via `DATABASE_URL` |
| Templates | Jinja2 (auto-escaping enabled) |
| Password storage | `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash` (scrypt) |
| Session security | `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=Lax`, CSRF tokens |
| Container | Docker + Docker Compose |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

---

## Demo Accounts

Three seed accounts are created automatically on first run:

| Role | Username | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin` | `admin@nexus.local` | `Admin1234` |
| Member | `member` | `member@nexus.local` | `Member1234` |
| Viewer | `viewer` | `viewer@nexus.local` | `Viewer1234` |

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Desktop | 24+ | [docs.docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |
| Docker Compose | v2+ | Included with Docker Desktop |
| Python | 3.11+ | [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| Git | 2.x | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| Supabase project | Free tier is enough | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) |

Python is only required for the non-Docker path or running tests locally.

---

## Installation

### Option A — Docker (Recommended)

Docker builds the image, initialises the database, and starts the app in one
command. The container serves the Flask app with Gunicorn over local HTTPS, so
no Python installation is required on the host.

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IfrahC/Build-and-Break-Secure-Application-Pipeline.git
cd Build-and-Break-Secure-Application-Pipeline
```

**2. Configure Supabase**

Create a `.env` file in the repository root from `.env.example` and paste your
Supabase Postgres connection string:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_REF:YOUR_PASSWORD@aws-0-REGION.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
```

Use Supabase's pooled Postgres connection string if your machine or deployment
environment needs IPv4 compatibility.

**3. Start the application**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

The first run builds the image, creates the Postgres schema in Supabase if it
does not exist yet, seeds the demo accounts, and starts the app. Subsequent
runs skip the build if nothing has changed:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

**4. Open in browser**

```
https://localhost:5000
```

The Docker image uses a self-signed local certificate so the session cookie can
keep the `Secure` flag required by the security findings. Your browser may show
a privacy warning for this local certificate; choose the advanced/continue
option for the demo, or trust the generated local certificate on your machine.

**Stop the application**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

**Rebuild after code changes**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

**Inspect the database directly**

Open the Supabase dashboard, choose your project, and use the SQL editor or
Table Editor to inspect `users`, `projects`, `tasks`, `feedback`, and
`activity_log`.

---

### Option B — Python Directly

Use this path for faster iteration during development.

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IfrahC/Build-and-Break-Secure-Application-Pipeline.git
cd Build-and-Break-Secure-Application-Pipeline
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows (PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

**4. Configure Supabase**

Create `.env` from `.env.example`, then set `DATABASE_URL` and
`FLASK_SECRET_KEY`. In PowerShell for a one-off local run:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_REF:YOUR_PASSWORD@aws-0-REGION.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require"
$env:FLASK_SECRET_KEY="replace-with-a-long-random-secret"
```

**5. Run the application**

```bash
cd app
python app.py
```

**6. Open in browser**

```
https://localhost:5000
```

For direct Python runs, HTTPS is available when `app/database/cert.pem` and
`app/database/key.pem` exist. The Docker path creates them automatically. The
Supabase/Postgres schema is created automatically on first run with the schema
and three seed accounts.

---

## Configuration

The application reads the following environment variables at startup. Docker
requires the Supabase/Postgres URL and a fixed secret key.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Required for Docker | Supabase Postgres connection string. |
| `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` | Required in production | Signs session cookies. Set a fixed value so sessions survive restarts. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `Admin1234` in Compose | Seed admin password. |
| `MEMBER_PASSWORD` | `Member1234` in Compose | Seed member password. |
| `VIEWER_PASSWORD` | `Viewer1234` in Compose | Seed viewer password. |
| `RATELIMIT_ENABLED` | `1` | Set to `0` only in tests. |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `0` | Set to `1` to enable the Werkzeug debugger. Never use in production. |
| `FLASK_RUN_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface to bind. The Docker image sets this to `0.0.0.0`. |

**Setting Supabase and session configuration (Docker):**

Create a `.env` file in the repository root:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_REF:YOUR_PASSWORD@aws-0-REGION.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-string
```

The compose file will pick it up automatically via the `environment` block.
Docker serves `https://localhost:5000` with a self-signed local certificate so
authenticated sessions can keep `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`.

---

## Features & Functionality

### Authentication & Sessions

- **Register** — new users sign up with a username, email, and password. The
  app validates format, uniqueness, minimum password length (8 characters + 1
  digit), and confirmed password match before creating the account.
- **Login** — accepts username or email. Passwords are verified with
  `check_password_hash` (scrypt). On success the session is cleared before new
  values are written (`session.clear()`), preventing session fixation.
- **Logout** — clears the entire session and redirects to the landing page.
- **CSRF protection** — every POST form includes a CSRF token generated with
  `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` and validated server-side before processing.
- **Session cookie flags** — `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` are set
  at the application level. The Docker runtime serves HTTPS so browsers will
  send secure session cookies.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Three roles are defined and enforced with the `@roles_required` decorator on
every protected route:

| Role | What they can do |
|---|---|
| **admin** | Everything. View and manage all projects, all tasks, all feedback, all users. Change any user's role via the admin panel. |
| **member** | Create and manage their own projects and tasks. Submit feedback. Cannot access other members' projects or the admin panel. |
| **viewer** | Read-only access to all projects. Cannot create, edit, or delete anything. Can submit feedback. |

Access control is enforced **server-side** in the route handler — changing a
role in the UI or forging a request does not bypass it.

### Projects

Projects are the core entity. Each project has a title, description, status,
and an owner.

**Statuses:** `Planning` | `Active` | `Blocked` | `Completed`

| Action | Who can do it |
|---|---|
| View project list | All authenticated users |
| Search by title / description | All authenticated users |
| Filter by status | All authenticated users |
| View project detail + tasks | Admin, Member (own projects only), Viewer (read-only) |
| Create project | Admin, Member |
| Edit project | Admin, or the Member who owns it |
| Delete project | Admin, or the Member who owns it |

**Validation rules:**
- Title: 3–80 characters
- Description: 10–500 characters
- Status: must be one of the four defined values

### Tasks

Tasks belong to a project and track individual work items.

**Fields:** title, assignee (any user), status, priority, due date (optional)

**Statuses:** `Todo` | `In Progress` | `Done`

**Priorities:** `Low` | `Medium` | `High`

| Action | Who can do it |
|---|---|
| View tasks on a project | Anyone who can view the project |
| Add task | Admin, or the Member who owns the parent project |
| Update task status / priority | Admin, or the Member who owns the parent project |
| Delete task | Admin, or the Member who owns the parent project |

Tasks are ordered by priority (High first) then due date when displayed.

### Feedback

Any authenticated user can submit feedback via the `/feedback` page.

**Categories:** `Bug` | `Security` | `Feature` | `General`

| Role | What they see on `/feedback` |
|---|---|
| Admin | All feedback from all users |
| Member / Viewer | Only their own submissions |

**Validation rules:**
- Category: must be one of the four defined values
- Message: 10–500 characters

### Activity Logging

Important application actions are written to the `activity_log` table:
registration, login/logout, project changes, task changes, feedback
submissions, and role changes. Admins can review the latest entries on the
admin page.

### Admin Panel

Accessible only to users with the `admin` role (`/admin`).

- View all registered users with their project count, feedback count, and role
- Change any user's role (admin / member / viewer) via a form
- Safety guard: if only one admin account exists, that admin's role cannot be
  downgraded (prevents lockout)
- View a project status breakdown summary
- View recent activity recorded in the database

### Dashboard

The dashboard at `/dashboard` is role-aware:

| Role | What they see |
|---|---|
| Admin | Total projects, total users, open tasks across all projects, open feedback items, 5 most recently updated projects |
| Member | Their own project count, their open task count, their 5 most recently updated projects |
| Viewer | Open task count assigned to them, recently updated projects |

## Database Schema

Runtime persistence uses Supabase Postgres through `DATABASE_URL`. The
Postgres schema is defined in `app/database/init_postgres.sql`; the SQLite
schema in `app/database/init.sql` is retained only for fast local tests.
Seed accounts are created by `app.py` on startup using
`generate_password_hash`.

## CI/CD Security Pipeline

Four GitHub Actions workflows run on push to `main` and on pull requests:

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAST | `sast.yml` | Push / PR | Bandit, Semgrep, TruffleHog |
| SCA | `sca.yml` | Push / PR / Weekly Monday 08:00 UTC | pip-audit, Safety |
| DAST | `dast.yml` | Push to `main` / Manual dispatch | OWASP ZAP baseline |
| Coverage | `coverage.yml` | Push / PR | pytest, coverage.py |

All workflows save results as downloadable artifacts under the **Actions** tab.
Workflows do not fail the pipeline on findings — findings are captured for
analysis and reporting.

### Running Tools Locally

**SAST — Static analysis**

```bash
pip install bandit semgrep

# Bandit
bandit -r app/
bandit -r app/ -f json -o bandit-results.json

# Semgrep
semgrep --config=auto app/
semgrep --config=auto --json --output=semgrep-results.json app/
```

**SCA — Dependency scanning**

```bash
pip install pip-audit "safety<3.0.0"

# pip-audit (OSV database)
pip-audit -r app/requirements.txt

# Safety (PyUp database)
safety check -r app/requirements.txt
```

**DAST — Dynamic scanning (app must be running first)**

```bash
# Start the app
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d

# ZAP baseline scan
docker run --rm -t ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy \
  zap-baseline.py -t http://host.docker.internal:5000

# ZAP full active scan with HTML report
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy \
  zap-full-scan.py -t http://host.docker.internal:5000 -r zap-report.html
```

> **Linux users:** replace `host.docker.internal` with `172.17.0.1`.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

With coverage:

```bash
pip install coverage
coverage run -m pytest tests/ -v
coverage report -m
coverage html -d coverage-html/
# Open coverage-html/index.html in a browser
```

The suite covers: public routes, registration validation, login/logout,
protected route redirects, member project CRUD, task lifecycle,
project search and filter, viewer read-only enforcement, member ownership
restrictions, admin role management, and feedback submission.

---

## Git Commit Guidelines

All commits must reference a GitHub Issue. Create the issue first, then commit
with the number in the message.

```bash
# Reference (keeps issue open)
git commit -m "Refs #5: add STRIDE table to threat model"

# Auto-close on merge to main
git commit -m "Fixes #5: complete threat model with STRIDE and risk matrix"

# Multiple issues
git commit -m "Fixes #6, #7: remediate XSS and SQL injection findings"
```

Auto-close keywords: `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`,
`resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved`.
